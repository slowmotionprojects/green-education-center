Nicknamed by the Yangtze people “Goddess of the Yangtze” (长江女神), it is a symbol of protection for local fishermen and boatmen.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is extremely unlikely that we will see one of these animals again: in 2006, after scientists failed to locate any remaining animals, it was declared “functionally extinct”. The tiny number of potentially surviving individuals is not enough to ensure the survival of the species.</p><p>The baiji is very well adapted to its environment: mostly blind, it uses sonar to navigate and hunt fish, swimming at up to 60 kilometers per hour. This adaptation is also partly what caused its demise: noise pollution cause the nearly blind animal to collide with the propellers of an increasing number of boats navigating the river in the second half of the twentieth century.</p><p>In addition, pollution, fishing nets, habitat loss, and hunting for its flesh and skin led to the disappearance of this sacred animal.</p>",
